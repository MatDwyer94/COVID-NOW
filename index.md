### Rashad Viviers

I am a 20-year-old student studying information technology as a bridge into software engineering. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe but moved to Australia when I was 4. Besides English I speak some Shona (The national language of Zimbabwe) and I am currently learning Korean. I started my schooling in 2005 at Algester Primary School and finished my Primary schooling there in 2011. I then moved to Stretton State College where I completed my senior schooling in 2016. After successfully completing my senior schooling I decided to further myself in multiple bachelors before deciding on Information Technology. I studied Engineering at Griffith University, Exercise Science at Australian Catholic University and Business at Griffith University. I have a huge passion for basketball which was the reason for choosing exercise science and a huge love of technology which majorly influenced my decision to do engineering and information technology.

### Min Jung Hong

s3755242

I was born and raised half of my life in a little island called Jeju in South Korea, When I turned 12 my family decided to move to Australia. My parents wanted me to experience and learn different stuff outside of Korea as Korean education is pretty harsh. Then I went to girls high school in Sydney. Being friends with people with different nationality taught me a lot in many ways. I don’t really have a hobby, but I like to going to art galleries to see the exhibitions. I like finding out old and new artists around the world, and experience different types of art forms and learn some histories and cultures from the artists and the art work. I also like to visit the gallery shops and buys some goods that are related to the exhibition. My Interest in IT at the moment is web designing and cyber security. This is because nowadays our society is more focused and lean on media. Due to that media will develop rapidly so I think web developing and designing and cyber security will become more essential. At the moment I don’t have any IT experience but I would like to experience various field in IT.
