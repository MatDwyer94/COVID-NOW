s3851521

I am a 20-year-old student studying information technology as a bridge into software engineering. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe but moved to Australia when I was 4. Besides English I speak some Shona (The national language of Zimbabwe) and I am currently learning Korean. I started my schooling in 2005 at Algester Primary School and finished my Primary schooling there in 2011. I then moved to Stretton State College where I completed my senior schooling in 2016. After successfully completing my senior schooling I decided to further myself in multiple bachelors before deciding on Information Technology. I studied Engineering at Griffith University, Exercise Science at Australian Catholic University and Business at Griffith University. I have a huge passion for basketball which was the reason for choosing exercise science and a huge love of technology which majorly influenced my decision to do engineering and information technology.

### Hayden Roworth

I’m a 24 yearly from Newcastle Australia. I currently work for Allianz Australia. I know a lot… if not too much about the Simpons. I can usually identify an episode within the first 30 seconds.

### Min Jung Hong

https://susie220.github.io/Assignment1-/

s3755242

I was born and raised half of my life in a little island called Jeju in South Korea, When I turned 12 my family decided to move to Australia. My parents wanted me to experience and learn different stuff outside of Korea as Korean education is pretty harsh. Then I went to girls high school in Sydney. Being friends with people with different nationality taught me a lot in many ways. I don’t really have a hobby, but I like to going to art galleries to see the exhibitions. I like finding out old and new artists around the world, and experience different types of art forms and learn some histories and cultures from the artists and the art work. I also like to visit the gallery shops and buys some goods that are related to the exhibition. My Interest in IT at the moment is web designing and cyber security. This is because nowadays our society is more focused and lean on media. Due to that media will develop rapidly so I think web developing and designing and cyber security will become more essential. At the moment I don’t have any IT experience but I would like to experience various field in IT.

My dream or ideal job: href='https://www.seek.com.au/job/41153311?type=standard#searchRequestToken=2e65d6c4-5fad-4098-914b-d47849b89144'> Network Administrator

**Description of Position**

The role of a network administrator makes you responsible for maintenance of a specific
computer network as well as solving any problems that occur with them. This appeals to
me because I enjoy being hands on as well as helping people. Being on the ground
essentially & trouble shooting makes it appealing as every day could be different
administrator and filled with different challenges.

**Skills and Qualifications required**

Qualifications for this role generally require a degree in network administration as well as
systems administration training. Effective communication skills are key as well as the
ability to demonstrate effective problem solving.

**Current Skills and Qualifications**

I currently have a basic understanding of the following:
- Setting up a network with multiple PCs, enabling sharing, printing etc
- Ability to troubleshoot a number of networking issues

**Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications**

I hope to obtain the relevant skills required for this position throughout the course of this
course. Ideally, after the basics are learnt I would like to tailor my courses toward this
position, ideally focusing on networking/cloud subjects to assist in growing my knowledge
and exposure.

### Rashad

![Job Advertisement](/idealJob4.jpeg)

**A description of the position**

The position calls for a software engineer. A software engineer deals with the crafting,
designing and development of software. Once it is developed, they look after testing,
evaluating and maintaining the software. This position is extremely appealing to me as I
am a very creative person who like puzzles. As each problem is similar to a puzzle, I look
to find the best solution of coding to perfectly fix the problem. The position is one that
requires a lot of patience and resilience which are two of my strongest characteristics.

**Skills and qualifications required**

The skills needed include the ability to code in multiple forms of coding. To get this high
level of coding skill I will need to complete a degree in information technology. By
completing the degree, I will learn the programming basics and advanced skills in all the
types of code mentioned in the job description. The skill to work cohesively in a team of
programmers is a necessity. The job description also implies that the person that fills this
role would need to have an outgoing personality as they are willing to help the successful
candidate build up their knowledge and fulfill personal goals in relations to programming.

**Current skills and qualifications**

Although I do have the ability to work cohesively in any team I am put into, I am
unfortunately lacking the practical skills and knowledge of coding. I am very outgoing and
find the idea of the employer being so open to supporting the successful candidate in their
pursuit of personal development extremely attractive. I have the ability to think outside
the box which will benefit me in creating each solution. I also possess a keen eye for
detail which will make the designing and development process of creating the software a
lot easier.

**Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications**

The required skills in coding are only obtainable by university study. A qualification in
Information technology will help me bridge into software engineering, where I can gain an
understanding on each type of coding and how to put it into practice. To be placed into a
role like this some experience in utilising university knowledge into practical use is
necessary. To gain the necessary experience, I hope to hold an entry level position in a
similar role.

### Summary

Within the Group there is a split down the middle. Matthew and Rashad look to further
their studies to develop skills in programming and both hope to utilise this in their role.
Min and Hayden look to further their studies to follow analytics and net development
which include similar features. The steps and procedures to get to the engineering roles
that Matthew and Rashad are very similar and include similar qualifications. Min and
Hayden’s Qualifications do differ as they are in separate streams of Information
technology. Even if there are similarities at the core of their roles, different
specialisations will be needed. In terms of time frames to achieve the ideal job there is a
general similarity in time frame with the groups average timeframe to achieve the ideal
job being approximately 5 years with the maximum and minimum time frame alleviating
approximately 1 year from that

# IT work

## Interview of IT professional – Aaron Roworth from OneBlink

### What kind of work is undertaken by yourself? Talk me though a day to day.

Primarily I write code, ranging from server-side code, APIs and front - end work. Lately this has primarily been integration work which involves a fair bit of research around the communicating systems and getting them to play nicely together. Lately I have been working very heavily with C sharp, but a typical day will see me working primarily with java script using node JS on the server side and a handful of frameworks for front end work. It’s not uncommon on a given day to assist with support queries which could be anything from troubleshooting problems with cloud infrastructure to helping our support staff track down a bug in an app or website.

### What kind of people do you interact with mostly? IT professionals, public, stakeholders?

Our organisation runs flat in terms of management on any given day I could be reporting directly to the CTO or to our Technical Delivery Manager. It also isn’t uncommon for me to be dealing directly with clients, though these are generally technical people within that organisation whether that be other developers, system admins or stakeholders in a project such as product managers. This can range from meeting discussing technical requirements to working one on one with these stakeholders to fulfil specific project requires.

### Where do you spend most of your time and why?

Most of my time at the office is either spent at my desk or inform of the coffee machine. We have the benefit of working in an open plan office where a conversation with a co-worker with is a simple as looking left or right and getting their attention. It’s just as easy to get a hold of our management team as more often or not their office doors are open. Every so often when required by project work we will travel directly to clients to meet with key stakeholders, this is generally no more than trip to Sydney or a few hours interstate.

### What is the most challenging aspect of your job and why?

There are many challenging aspects of my job, it wouldn’t offer the excitement that it does without these challenges. For me personally, its keeping up to date with the changing landscape that is web development whether these be new cloud technologies or simply a “better way to do something, you need to consider what is best practice and how you can iterate on a particular way to solve a problem”

# IT Technologies

## Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices

These technologies boil down to two main categories. Microcontrollers, and Microcomputers. Microcontrollers such as Arduinos and Makey Makeys mostly consist of a control board with a large Integrated Circuit (IC). The IC is the heart of the microcontroller where all programming is stored where all commands for anything attached to the board are sent from and received. The control board itself helps to facilitate to connection between the IC any connected peripherals, as well as giving it the ability to directly connect to a computer for programming. They can be used to make almost any type of digital electronic imaginable, from robots, to 3D printers, to any other custom designed project.

Microcomputers, such as the raspberry pi, on the other hand are more or less what they sound like. They are extremely small and compact computers. They actually use microcontrollers to be able to accomplish this. They are a completely self contained, single board computer, with everything already on the board needed to operate (Including RAM and a CPU). Both of these technologies are becoming more and more widespread and accessible to people across the globe, enabling more people to gain access to, and learn about stuff like programming and coding languages, and how electronics and computers work.

All of these things have been in rapid changing development over the last few years, and have seen significant changes and improvements from their first forms. They have even branched out into more specialised forms in some cases. For example, Arduinos come in many different shapes with differing capabilities in each. You have the basic model called the UNO that most people use for prototyping and developing, the MEGA which is effectively a larger UNO with more connections and a larger memory. Specified ones like the Lilypad, which has a circular form and is primarily focused on running LED lighting displays. And finally there is the Nano which is similar in capabilities as the UNO but in a much smaller form factor, enabling it to be able to be integrated into projects with a much tighter size restraint.

Over the next few years, it is likely we will continue to see these technologies branch out even further into even more specialised and niche forms for various different industries. This is all helped by the fact that they are all open source. Open source means that anyone is free to access diagrams and the source code that makes them run, and create their own.

This is important, because it enables anyone who would like to use the technology in a specific way it doesn’t exist in yet, or who may have an idea for an improvement for it, to create their own versions of it and further the progress of the overall technology.

None of these would ever have been possible if it wasn’t for the advent of microelectronics and IC’s. Because an IC is basically an entire circuit made extraordinarily small and put inside a tiny chip, the development of being making electronics smaller and smaller was absolutely crucial. The largest impacts of this technology come from large scale automation, and accessibility of electronics for learning. Due to the low cost of these items, they are being used much more by educators to teach people at younger and younger ages, basic coding and electronics skills. This is extremely important as these skills are becoming much more valuable and sought after in todays job climate, especially as more jobs become automated.

The automation of jobs will have both a negative and positive impact on jobs. While it will eliminate certain positions and greatly reduce or completely eliminate the need for certain skills, it will create a large need for people who can build, repair, operate and maintain these machines. This will primarily effect people with simple repetitive jobs, as those will be the easiest to automate. So far, the technology does still have its limits.

Another big effect will be on the manufacturing sector. The ability to rapidly prototype and experiment makes the process of designing a new product much simpler and quicker. Even with physical manufacturing, 3D printers, which almost all rely on an Arduino based motherboard, have made it extremely easy to test product designs to find any physical flaws in it’s design, without having to waste time and expensive materials on creating full scale prototypes. In my own life, it effects what sorts of things I choose to study and learn to help my career prospects in the future. For example, I have been learning about 3D printing technologies and arduinos in my own spare time, both for my own curiosity, as well as building helpful skills for my desired future career.

I don’t believe there will be more effects on my family, than most other people. The main thing I see happening is more and more smart home and home automation items becoming common place and used on a regular basis. They already own such item as a google hub, and a chromecast which are used on an almost daily basis.

I can feasibly see it affecting my father as he is an electrician, and it may become expected for them to have at least a basic knowledge of how these things work to be able to install them in homes where in built home automation is desired.

My friends will likely be affected quite a lot more, due to them being in a wide variety of industries. In fact, due to the current global issues happening right now (I.e Coronavirus) it may happen sooner than expected. Friends working in nursing have seen people who are trying to help make up for the lack in medical equipment designed to handle this situation. They are designing such things as cheap and easily made automatic ventilators, and other people using 3D printers to create face masks and other exceedingly useful equipment.

## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is used for the practice on protecting networks, programs and systems from cyber
attacks. These digital attacks are normally aimed at changing, accessing and damaging sensitive
personal information such as extorting money from users and interrupting normal business
process (Unknown). In order to have a successful cybersecurity is to have multiple layers of
protection across the networks, programs, computers and data that need to be kept safe and
secure. In a company such as organisations, the technology, processes and people must
contribute one another to create a strong and effective defence from digital attacks.

It is very challenging these days to implement effectiveness of cybersecurity measure as there
are many attackers becoming more innovative and more technologies and devices than people.
World like today where everything is connected, people are benefited from advanced cyber
defence programs. Because everyone relies their important information online, securing critical
infrastructure like power plants, hospitals and financial service companies are essential in order to
keep the society functioning.

To get to know how to secure the shared digital future, the users must understand how things
work. First of all, people all must understand how the security community believes the cyberthreat
will change and the consequent risk landscape will be transformed. This critical and urgent
analysis must be based on evidence and research, and must leverage the expertise of those in
academia, the technical community and policymakers around the world. By doing this, the security
ecosystem can help build a new generation of cybersecurity defences and partnerships that will
enable global prosperity(Unknown).

Driven by a new generation of transformative technology, the cybersecurity landscape is more
likely to be changed significantly within next 3 years and even in the next 10 years, the past 10
years was the only the beginning of the global cybersecurity journey. New architectures and
cooperation are required as we stand at the brink of a new era of cybercrime, which will be
empowered by new and emergent technology.

### Cloud Technology

It is known that cloud technology have a major impact on the revolution of security technology.
Nowadays many business organisations and government related agencies are using the cloud
technology to store vital informations every day. The cloud gives more security approaches and
techniques.

Mechanisms such as virtualised firewalls, virtualised intrusion detection, and preventions systems,
and virtualised systems can now be used from the cloud. For example, most businesses have
increased their data centre security by using IaaS services(Unknown).

### 5G networks

5G networks will the new generation of the single most challenging issue of the cybersecurity
landscape. This networks is not just designed for fast internet, it means that the world will go into a
new era, possibly by 2025, 75 billion new devices will be connecting to the internet every year,
running critical applications and infrastructure at nearly 1,000 times the speed of the current
internet(William Dixon,2019). This will be a better chance for connecting whole new communities,
geographies and industries, but at the same time it will a high risk of threat landscape, as it
enables the cybercrime to move from being an invisible(William Dixon,2019).

This 5G network will provide any cyber attackers with fast access to vulnerable networks. When
enterprise and operational technology is combined, a new type of cyberattacks will be born and
there are already some that exists.

“The recent ransomware attack against the US city of Baltimore, for example, locked 10,000
employees out of their workstations. In the near future, smart city infrastructures will provide
interconnected systems at a new scale, from transport systems for driverless cars, automated
water and waste systems, to emergency workers and services, all interdependent and - potentially - as highly vulnerable as they are highly connected. In 2017, the WannaCry attack that took parts
of the UK’s National Health Service down took days to spread globally, but in a 5G era the malware
would spread this attack at the speed of light. It is clear that 5G will not only enable great prosperity
and help to save people’s lives, it will also have the capacity to thrust cybercrime into the real world
at a scale and with consequences yet unknown”(Dmitry Samartsev,2019).

### Hardware Authentication

The use of usernames and passwords are one of the well known shortcoming in cybersecurity, and
there is a need for a more strong and secure form of authentication. One of the recent technologies
is the use of authentication hardware.
For example, “Intel is now using this technology where it combines a variety of hardware enhanced
factors simultaneously to validate a user’s identity. Hardware authentication is
particularly important in IoT where networks need to make sure that anything trying to gain access
to it is permitted to do so”(Unknown).

Cyberattacks have huge impact on political, economic and social systems in which we live, but not
only those organisations, individuals get huge impact on cyberattacks of affecting personal data
and privacy. I personally have not experienced any cyberattacks in my life, but as an individuals it
is that the average person needs to be increasingly cautious when it comes to protect their
personal information and data.

The straightforward response is that the average person needs to be increasingly cautious when it
comes to protecting their personal data. The implications for the average person range from
identity theft to financial losses to reputational damage resulting from non-consensual data dumps.
Email accounts, social media sites, and other personal information have already been
compromised (e.g., Equifax, OPM breaches)(Unknown,2018).

It’s important to remember that although high profile breaches garner the most media attention,
many cyber attacks are extremely personal. Social accounts, webcams, hacked emails and mobile
phones give numerous attack vectors for domestic assailants. As this takes up large part to the proliferation and accessibility of digital weapons, spyware and other surveillance tools can be
implanted. Therefore average person should follow some of the key tenets of safety when it comes
to password security and multi-factor authentication.

As long as our network is well protected and maintained, I do not think there will be major impact
on my friends and family. But we cannot assume it is safe, because there are always unexpected
things that might happen.

## Cloud Services and Servers

Cloud technology is accessing and storing data over the internet instead of a physical hard drive.
Put simply, this technology assists in the delivery of different services including accessing things
like storage or databases as well software to allow faster innervation, ease of access to resources
which in turn can potentially lower operational costs of a business. Cloud services are typically
broken down into 3 types, SaaS - software as a service, IaaS - infrastructure as a service and
PaaS – platform as a service.

Software as a service delivers the ability to access software or applications over the internet or
through a browser. One of the most well-known and popular type of this technology would be
Microsoft’s Office 365. It is common for SaaS applications to allow customers to enable addons
and modifications through an extensive configuration environment.

Infrastructure as a service outlines storage capability for a user, ranging from low end data storage
to high end databases. As outlined in software as a service Microsoft again brings a key
component to the table with OneDrive as well as Googles cloud platform. OneDrive and Google
Drive offer day to day use either on a personal scale or small business to allow easy access to
data via multiple avenues utilising the internet. Another large platform is Apples iCloud, allowing
people who own any iProduct to store and access from any of those devices at any time allowing
seamless collaboration or access of information when required. For business use, Dropbox is a
highlight as it uses a system like that of Windows explorer, allowing ease of access and automatic
backups saving within a system similar to that of regular saving process.

Platform as a service or PaaS technology integrates into a business already made software
infrastructure. It’s primary services assist in application design and testing for deployment,
integration of web based services as well as but not limited to database integration. This is mainly
executed through a cloud service providers infrastructure with users gaining access through a web
browser. Platform as a service can offer services such as application hosting or program
development which can be delivered through a public or private cloud. The principal benefit for this
type of technology is for convenience and simplicity.

These technologies have drastically grown over the past 20 years and cloud technology model has
altered the way organisations manage their technology systems and resources. Previously
businesses wanting to grow their own IT systems were required to establish their own
infrastructure which in turn could increase operating costs of a business as well as time and space
to maintain those pieces of equipment. Now, business can access endless opportunity that is cloud
computing. Allowing business to access data storage, software or essentially any of the 3
technology types outlined above at a reduced cost. These systems are maintained and managed
by a third party therefore allowing businesses to have the most current technologies without the
stress of maintenance costs and time.

Some of the positive impact of these technologies on businesses are costs, flexibility and increase
of capacity. Costs for businesses are reduced due to no further requirement to self-manage and
maintain the infrastructure. Costs for a business could go from thousands of dollars to a billing
system or service. Flexibility of these technologies allow ease of access to software. In the
instance where software developers need an environment to test or deploy products this can easily
be done utilising PaaS technologies. Benefits of storage capacity work with flexibility and ease of
collaboration. Allowing businesses to store data remotely allows them to have larger capacity and
the ability to access it from any machine on their network. In turn positive impacts that a business
may face is Improved productivity, ease of access as well as reduction in costs.

Negative impacts include Vendor lock-in, security breaches & loss of data. The initial service a
vendor may offer would likely be aligned with your business needs. A barrier faced with this is
when a business expands it’s need for further services the initial vendor may not offer this which
could lead to further costs changing vendors or the inability to do so due to a contact. Leaking of
sensitive data is a large privacy breach which could have legal consequence. Allowing a third party
to store this data may be one of greatest impacts when forming a decision to migrate to cloud
services. Loss of any data is a large concern to a person or business. Leaving the tasks of
backups, storage and maintenance to a third party would be a great risk initially. As a preventative
measure business could store data locally as well but that would ultimately defeat the purpose of
utilising that technology.

On a personal level, this technology is of benefit especially at work. At work I rely on being able to
access the network drives to ensure my day runs smoothly. Working from home in the current
climate the whole business is reliant on the use of Citrix Storefront which runs a virtual desktop and
allows us to work remotely. Outside of work I regally use OneDrive between my laptop and desktop
as well as iCloud for my phone. Utilising the technology to be able to complete these studies online
is another highlight as working full time & physically attending a university would be impossible.
With the growth of technologies allowing us to access services remotely will have an impact on a
person’s social skills and mental health. My goal in this field is to get into cloud & networking, so
hopefully the technology continues to grow and become dependant on allowing future potential
opportunities for myself and others with interest in this field.

## Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

**What does it do?**

_What is the state of the art of this new technology?_

Within the world of cryptocurrencies, three major cryptocurrencies have set themselves apart from
the rest. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have now been plastered on billboards, their names read
out on repeat on advertisements and for very good reason too. In 2017 the world witnessed the
peak of bitcoin and for many this was the first-time hearing of Cryptocurrencies. Many thought that
it was just a trend, but the virtual currencies have taken the world by storm. When Bitcoin rose to
peak popularity, Ethereum and Ripple soon followed suite as many were entranced by this new
form of currency and researched the new craze. Bitcoin remains the leader with a market value of
approximately $7,000 and a Market Cap of 129.73 billion dollars whereas Ethereum has a value of
$170.89 and a market cap of 18.79 billion dollars. Lastly, Ripple, which has a miniscule value of
$0.1885 to date but relies on it’s market cap of $8.31 billion dollars to thank for its popularity.

_What can be done now?_

So what can be done now? The process of acquiring cryptocurrencies is quite simple. Similar to
how most acquire currency, completion of a task or job is required to accumulate cryptocurrency.
The accumulation of earning cryptocurrency and completing this exchange is called mining
cryptocurrency or cryptomining. When a sale or purchase is made using cryptocurrency, it is called
a ‘transaction’. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised meaning that they are not reliant on a
middleman or third party such as banks and point of sale systems. Due to the fact they are
decentralised, miners must achieve the same effect without these institutions, which is done by
collecting transactions together in “blocks”. These are then further organised and collected into a
public record called a blockchain. A major part of the process is miners ensuring that the
transactions are accurate. To be more precise, the issue of double spending needs to be negated.

The process of mining can be summarised into four steps. The first being that they must verify 1
megabyte of transactions. Theoretically, this amount can be 1 transaction but in most cases are
several thousand depending on the amount of data each transaction stores. Second, when adding
a block to the blockchain, miners must add a proof of work which is the solution to a complex
computational math problem. They must come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number known as a
“hash” that is equal to or less than the target hash. This is completely random as a miner’s
computer spits out hashes at different rates (mega hashes, giga hashes or tera hashes) guessing
the possible 64-digit figures until a solution is derived.

_What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?_

With the recent pandemic affecting the world, many have lost sources of income and look for new
ways to provide for their families. With no real time frame on when the end of quarantine let alone
a cure will come, there is a multitude of individuals looking for a form of income. Especially due to
social distancing, the mining of cryptocurrency is a very valid form of income. Within the next 1-2
years, I expect to see leaps and bounds in the amount of crypto-miners.

_What technological or other developments make this possible?_

Due to the sheer immense power and processing demands, using an every day computer is a
sheer disadvantage and may become a liability. Instead, computers have been made with
processors that are capable to keep up with those demands and limit power consumption to the
very necessary needed. These computers although very simplistic make mining for
Cryptocurrency a lot more convenient than other models that are more complex.

**What is the likely impact?**

_What is the potential impact of this development?_

The primary shift from conventional banking methods is inevitable. Within a digital age that thrives
on technology, it is only a matter of time until the procedures we take and even our currencies
become digital. Unifying and incorporating other countries into the market of cryptocurrency is a
major potential impact. In a global scale, the nature of the cryptocurrency market (noncorrelated)
acts as a potential hedge against any risks that may come up. For example, the government of
Venezuela have recently created and launched the Petro, it’s own cryptocurrency made to
circumvent the capital restrictions the country is under.

_Which people will be most affected and how?_

In some shape, way or form we are all affected by an exponential surge in cryptocurrency. But
those that would be majorly affected would be those in third world countries or whose domestic
currency is mismanaged. The intolerable steady decline in value of these currencies make the idea
of cryptocurrencies, which are still a gamble, much more ideal to their situation. In countries that
have put strict capital controls in place which then control the flow of money or have high taxes,
cryptocurrencies can be used to circumvent capital controls and taxes. In the grand scheme some
of these may not be legal transactions and so the good does come with the bad. In the grand
scheme, the positive side of cryptocurrencies severely outweigh the negatives.

_Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?_

The rise of cryptocurrencies has led to the creation of jobs. With a blooming market that is
individual and separate from most other markets, it is very difficult for cryptocurrencies to replace
or make other jobs redundant. The jobs that have been created within the market of Crypto include
miners, data scientists, developers, project managers and cryptocurrency analysts.

**How will this affect you?**

_In your daily life, how will this affect you?_

Cryptocurrencies have formed many jobs since it’s creation which have acted as a solid form of
income for some and a side hustle for many. In the current state of the world, with the pandemic
affecting many homes and limiting the income available and the roles provided to create the
stream of income, cryptocurrencies have created a stream to retrieve that income. Whilst many
jobs have been shutdown as we are forced to stay indoors, working from home and utilising
equipment geared to crypto may come as a blessing in this time. With speculation of a financial
crisis coming, the use of crypto may come handy when markets take a plummet, as it is non
dependant on other markets.

_What will be different for you?_

For the meantime the form in which I receive my income, however, in the long term the use of
digital and cryptocurrencies may become more common. Some jobs may even become dependant
on the skills needed to add to blockchains and knowledge of cryptocurrencies might become a vital
skill.

_How might this affect members of your family or your friends?_

When looking at a social affect, not in the greater population but simply in our small circles, we
must think of both the good and the negative. The positive effects are the addition of an income
stream for some of those who may not have one at the moment, the possibility to utilise
transactions that are digital minimizing the effects of the coronavirus and allowing a market to
flourish in a time where it was set to plummet and the usability of the P2P or person to person
feature to make transactions between people or a group easier. The negatives also include the
possibility of this money being used incorrectly or fraudulent data being utilised. To be more
specific double spending. The elderly will struggle at first with grasping the technology and this is a
major risk as they may need to adapt and of it is not done quickly or at all, this will put them at
potential risk of being scammed.

# Project Ideas

Individual’s project ideas were creating an application, but as two team members came up with
current sudden explosion in cases of Covid-19, we decided to create an app and a device that can
be useful for Covid-19.

## Overview

Our project will be creating an app and a device that allow the users to utilise its functions to both
call and monitor the wearer of the device. The device should be a wristband and the app should be
available to both IOS and Android devices. It will be given out for those who got caught of the virus
for those remain self-quarantine at home with symptoms. The basic monitoring needs should be
heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. It can also be utilised with the elderly and those
with illnesses or disabilities. The ability to drop in should be one way but an emergency drop in
button will be added in case a call towards the user needs to be placed.

The app will have a two sections, personal health and Covid-19. Personal health section will show
what is being monitored in the device. The users of this app can send their daily health
results(heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature), created as an email to the
National Corona Virus Helpline or to a hospital that deals with Covid-19 if they need to report.
For Covid-19 section, it will show world wide graphs of people who got infected, died and cured.
But the main informations will be focused on Australia’s current Covid-19 situation. It will have upto-
dated news and any reported case of new infected patients. This app will give every little details
of Covid-19.

## Motivation

Not only Australians but people around the world are panicking and afraid of what is happening
right now and that is also including our team member. People always want to know all the little
things related to this situation, like many people have been tested positive, died and cured. Also
there those people have been in contacted while they did not find out they were tested positive.
Even though these details are quickly undated in the news, media and through people’s mouth,
people are still slow and some might not look up for a news.

For the device, one of the major reasons people are travelling instead of locking down is to visit
family or friends. With elderly people being most at risk of the virus, most travel would be directed
towards them. The ability to drop in on those you hold near and dear that may not have the
electronic understanding is vital and could help keep travelling to the minimum. The ability to
monitor them from the comfort of an app will also minimise the travel.

## Description

First of all, the app is all about COVID-19 and the patients health checks.
It is always so hard to get in touch with exact information about what is going on around this
country and the world. People normally tend to get informations through media, younger people
may get informations from Facebook or by moouth to mouth from their peers, so there are always
some errors on the information, fake news and vides. The app will have all the information about
COVID-19, it will be handy as because rather then searching up news from google and Facebook it
will show everything in one click to the app. The informations will be accurate as it will based on
Australia Government Department of Health.

Health monitoring is the one of the major feature for the device. The desired aspects it would
monitor are body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. These are the easiest and most
feasible of the human "vitals" to monitor in a device this size. These vitals are also very simplistic
monitors of health.

The app will be essential to the project and will be used by those monitoring. As this device is
being used to monitor, it will be of great use if a feature of the app was a tracker.

The service will include:

_Current Status_

- Current situation and case number In Australia and Current situation and case number across
the world showing graphs and number of those got infected, death and cured.
- Official Government response and alerts to the COVID-19 outbreak
- A Map showing locations where confirmed cases of COVID-19 has happened with time and
date(information based on Australian Government Health Alert)

_Information about COVID-19_

- Latest News and Media(videos) related to COVID-19 for Australia and Worldwide
- Resources( A list of resources in English about COVID-19, including fact sheets, guidelines and
other publications, there will a link connected to Department of health page so users can
download easily into their phones and tablet PCs
- Frequently asked question about COVID-19
- Symptoms(List of symptoms listed form early stage of the virus.
- How to protect guide(List of to do list to prevent from catching the virus)
- List of hospitals and clinics where concerned users with symptoms can get tested with specific
details(name of the hospital/address)
- Conversation section where users can write about their concerns and opinion about the
situations
- Users can share information about where and what time users can get essential supplies(If the
users set their location it will show the nearest supermarket)
- Phone number of National Corona Virus Helpline
- It will give alerts for new cases that have been founded, for example “Myer Castle Hill has
closed immediately after it was confirmed an employee had contracted COVID-19”
- “ Total number of confirmed case of COVID-19 reached up to 1000 in Australia”
If the users click this alert it will direct them to the page about the news.

_Personal Health Checks_

- monitor body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate.
- Daily, weekly and monthly data will be stored and graphed.
- Overall monitoring and real-life data but by using this data, the app and device can calibrate to
ensure that real data is used instead of estimates.
- When real data is used the accuracy of alerts and monitoring also increases.

_The Device_

- Will have ability to “drop in” which is pared with the feature of real time GPS.
- When logged into the app, the device will feed the wearers geographical location to the app.
- The geographical location feature also plays a crucial part if anything were to go wrong with the
wearer
- When the emergency drop in button is used on the wearer's device, the device will attempt to
contact 3 saved contacts within the database.
- Whoever picks up first will have the option to call the emergency number of whatever country
the wearer is in. This is why it is imperative to have geographical location on the device.
- The last feature will be the ability to share results and data recorded on the app.The recored
data can be sent straight away to clinics and hospitals near by the of the wearers place using
real time GPS.

## Tools and Technologies

To create an app, MIT App Inventor based on Firebase will be needed.
Firebase will be useful to update any number of apps with new data. In addition by using Firebase
as a datastore, it allows to leverage its website authentication in the apps to take care of the user
management needs for example sign-up and login. Javascript code will also be needed to as it
include a static HTML file, which then can be added to the apps created with App Inventor. By
making simple modifications it allows the App Inventor to look inside the running javascript. The
hardware needed would be the casing and shell of the device. The shell component will need to be
sturdy due to the wearers and must be of a light material whilst being aesthetically appealing. A
clean plastic casing with a comfortable yet breathable silicone wristband.

## Skills required

Required skills are:

- Designing the app, the appearance is important as users want it to be attractive as well as
delivering a smooth experience and value.
- product management, get to know the client’s vision behind the app.
- Communication, between the team. Inventor, design, product managing.
- Cross- Platform, Android, iOS, or Windows
- Data Collected and Market research, Date will show how the app is recognised and will show
the end-results.
- Coding, such as HTML5, Java, C++, Objective-C, Swift and C#.
- Security, Users private information must be secured. and to as the app is data based, it has to
make sure no one can heck the app and change the date.
- Marketing, to let people know that this kind app exist in the market

## Outcome

If the project is successful, it would greatly impact those who care for the elderly, and
those with an illness during self-quarantine. Even though this project is focused on COVID-19,
people can still use the device as their health tracker and later on when COVID-19 become less
popular in our society, the app can contain other health alerts and tips and other health related
informations.

# Group Reflections

### Min

_What went well_

Everyone pretty much had what they wanted to do, and we ended up deciding
the parts equally.

_What could be improved_

It would be better if we started the assignment earlier so it can more
organised in time

_As least one thing that was surprising_

Even though we started the assignment a bit later
because the group was changed, everyone managed to finish their part on time and no one
would complain on their part.

_At least one thing that you have learned about groups_

During group assignment I have learnt
that having a frequent conversation is important in order to have good outcome. Asking
questions to each other.

### Hayden

_What went well_

We gelled well from the get-go and had no puch back on ideas. Strong communication & planned what each individual needed to contribute with ease.

_What could be improved_

Discussion on when each other were available/plan for whole assignment

_As least one thing that was surprising_

How well we got stuck in with no one complaining. Everyone completing their work on time & having effective contributions.

_At least one thing that you have learned about groups_

Having clear communication helps deliver a good outcome.

### Rashad

_What went well_

The group was very effective in terms of communication and time management.  The group managed to play into each other’s strengths. With no clear leader, the group was able to be dependant and independent when needed and knew when to contribute and when to take a step back. This was imperative to our success.

_What could be improved_

Setting deadlines and planning could definitely be improved. These would’ve helped but definitely are extras as the teamwork was very smooth.

_At least one thing that was surprising_

The teamwork was very effective. Everything was completed on time and no arguments came up. The teamwork made this assignment smooth.

_At least one thing that you have learned about groups_

It is important to rely on other’s skills and abilities. It also pays to listen and learn instead of constantly looking for ways to contribute.

### Matthew

_What went well_

The group seemed to have fairly decent communication and cohesiveness. Everyone was extremely agreeable and cooperative, meaning decision making was very quick and easy.

_What could be improved_

The grouo came together rather late. so it did limit the time we had to complete the assignment and figure out what everyone did. I think trying to find a tool to share and have everyones work in one place and organised would be beneficial rather than sharing it all over the messaging app.

_At least one thing that was surprising_

How easily we all came together and there was no arguing or push back.

_At least one thing that you have learned about groups_

That is have skills that other don't and that they can be utilised quite well.
