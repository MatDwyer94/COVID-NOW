## Personal Information

### Mathew Dwyer

s3807459

I have had several jobs, primarily in hospitality and retail. I have had some volunteer roles running stage sound and lighting for my local regional show. My hobbies include building and working on electronics, designing projects for arduino and playing DnD. My primary interest in IT is in software design, automation, and cybersecurity. Currently I don’t have any formal experience in IT, but I am self taught in a lot of areas. I currently help maintain the website at the current retail place I work at.

### Rashad Viviers

s3851521

I am a 20-year-old student studying information technology as a bridge into software engineering. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe but moved to Australia when I was 4. Besides English I speak some Shona (The national language of Zimbabwe) and I am currently learning Korean. I started my schooling in 2005 at Algester Primary School and finished my Primary schooling there in 2011. I then moved to Stretton State College where I completed my senior schooling in 2016. After successfully completing my senior schooling I decided to further myself in multiple bachelors before deciding on Information Technology. I studied Engineering at Griffith University, Exercise Science at Australian Catholic University and Business at Griffith University. I have a huge passion for basketball which was the reason for choosing exercise science and a huge love of technology which majorly influenced my decision to do engineering and information technology.

### Hayden Roworth

s3856099

I’m a 24 yearly from Newcastle Australia. I currently work for llianz Australia. I know a lot… if not too much about the Simpons. I can usually identify an episode within the first 30 seconds.

### Min Jung Hong

s3755242

I was born and raised half of my life in a little island called Jeju in South Korea, When I turned 12 my family decided to move to Australia. My parents wanted me to experience and learn different stuff outside of Korea as Korean education is pretty harsh. Then I went to girls high school in Sydney. Being friends with people with different nationality taught me a lot in many ways. I don’t really have a hobby, but I like to going to art galleries to see the exhibitions. I like finding out old and new artists around the world, and experience different types of art forms and learn some histories and cultures from the artists and the art work. I also like to visit the gallery shops and buys some goods that are related to the exhibition. My Interest in IT at the moment is web designing and cyber security. This is because nowadays our society is more focused and lean on media. Due to that media will develop rapidly so I think web developing and designing and cyber security will become more essential. At the moment I don’t have any IT experience but I would like to experience various field in IT.

# IT work

## Interview of IT professional – Aaron Roworth from OneBlink

### What kind of work is undertaken by yourself? Talk me though a day to day.

Primarily I write code, ranging from server-side code, APIs and front - end work. Lately this has primarily been integration work which involves a fair bit of research around the communicating systems and getting them to play nicely together. Lately I have been working very heavily with C sharp, but a typical day will see me working primarily with java script using node JS on the server side and a handful of frameworks for front end work. It’s not uncommon on a given day to assist with support queries which could be anything from troubleshooting problems with cloud infrastructure to helping our support staff track down a bug in an app or website.

### What kind of people do you interact with mostly? IT professionals, public, stakeholders?

Our organisation runs flat in terms of management on any given day I could be reporting directly to the CTO or to our Technical Delivery Manager. It also isn’t uncommon for me to be dealing directly with clients, though these are generally technical people within that organisation whether that be other developers, system admins or stakeholders in a project such as product managers. This can range from meeting discussing technical requirements to working one on one with these stakeholders to fulfil specific project requires.

### Where do you spend most of your time and why?

Most of my time at the office is either spent at my desk or inform of the coffee machine. We have the benefit of working in an open plan office where a conversation with a co-worker with is a simple as looking left or right and getting their attention. It’s just as easy to get a hold of our management team as more often or not their office doors are open. Every so often when required by project work we will travel directly to clients to meet with key stakeholders, this is generally no more than trip to Sydney or a few hours interstate.

### What is the most challenging aspect of your job and why?

There are many challenging aspects of my job, it wouldn’t offer the excitement that it does without these challenges. For me personally, its keeping up to date with the changing landscape that is web development whether these be new cloud technologies or simply a “better way to do something, you need to consider what is best practice and how you can iterate on a particular way to solve a problem”

# IT Technologies

## Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices

These technologies boil down to two main categories. Microcontrollers, and Microcomputers. Microcontrollers such as Arduinos and Makey Makeys mostly consist of a control board with a large Integrated Circuit (IC). The IC is the heart of the microcontroller where all programming is stored where all commands for anything attached to the board are sent from and received. The control board itself helps to facilitate to connection between the IC any connected peripherals, as well as giving it the ability to directly connect to a computer for programming. They can be used to make almost any type of digital electronic imaginable, from robots, to 3D printers, to any other custom designed project.

Microcomputers, such as the raspberry pi, on the other hand are more or less what they sound like. They are extremely small and compact computers. They actually use microcontrollers to be able to accomplish this. They are a completely self contained, single board computer, with everything already on the board needed to operate (Including RAM and a CPU). Both of these technologies are becoming more and more widespread and accessible to people across the globe, enabling more people to gain access to, and learn about stuff like programming and coding languages, and how electronics and computers work.

All of these things have been in rapid changing development over the last few years, and have seen significant changes and improvements from their first forms. They have even branched out into more specialised forms in some cases. For example, Arduinos come in many different shapes with differing capabilities in each. You have the basic model called the UNO that most people use for prototyping and developing, the MEGA which is effectively a larger UNO with more connections and a larger memory. Specified ones like the Lilypad, which has a circular form and is primarily focused on running LED lighting displays. And finally there is the Nano which is similar in capabilities as the UNO but in a much smaller form factor, enabling it to be able to be integrated into projects with a much tighter size restraint.

Over the next few years, it is likely we will continue to see these technologies branch out even further into even more specialised and niche forms for various different industries. This is all helped by the fact that they are all open source. Open source means that anyone is free to access diagrams and the source code that makes them run, and create their own.

This is important, because it enables anyone who would like to use the technology in a specific way it doesn’t exist in yet, or who may have an idea for an improvement for it, to create their own versions of it and further the progress of the overall technology.

None of these would ever have been possible if it wasn’t for the advent of microelectronics and IC’s. Because an IC is basically an entire circuit made extraordinarily small and put inside a tiny chip, the development of being making electronics smaller and smaller was absolutely crucial. The largest impacts of this technology come from large scale automation, and accessibility of electronics for learning. Due to the low cost of these items, they are being used much more by educators to teach people at younger and younger ages, basic coding and electronics skills. This is extremely important as these skills are becoming much more valuable and sought after in todays job climate, especially as more jobs become automated.

The automation of jobs will have both a negative and positive impact on jobs. While it will eliminate certain positions and greatly reduce or completely eliminate the need for certain skills, it will create a large need for people who can build, repair, operate and maintain these machines. This will primarily effect people with simple repetitive jobs, as those will eb the easiest to automate. So far, the technology does still have its limits.

Another big effect will be on the manufacturing sector. The ability to rapidly prototype and experiment makes the process of designing a new product much simpler and quicker. Even with physical manufacturing, 3D printers, which almost all rely on an Arduino based motherboard, have made it extremely easy to test product designs to find any physical flaws in it’s design, without having to waste time and expensive materials on creating full scale prototypes. In my own life, it effects what sorts of things I choose to study and learn to help my career prospects in the future. For example, I have been learning about 3D printing technologies and arduinos in my own spare time, both for my own curiosity, as well as building helpful skills for my desired future career.

I don’t believe there will be more effects on my family, than most other people. The main thing I see happening is more and more smart home and home automation items becoming common place and used on a regular basis. They already own such item as a google hub, and a chromecast which are used on an almost daily basis.

I can feasibly see it affecting my father as he is an electrician, and it may become expected for them to have at least a basic knowledge of how these things work to be able to install them in homes where in built home automation is desired.

My friends will likely be affected quite a lot more, due to them being in a wide variety of inductries. In fact, due to the current global issues happening right now (I.e Coronavirus) it may happen sooner than expected. Friends working in nursing have seen people who are trying to help make up for the lack in medical equipment designed to handle this situation. They are designing such things as cheap and easily made automatic ventilators, and other people using 3D printers to create face masks and other exceedingly useful equipment.

## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is used for the practice on protecting networks, programs and systems from cyber
attacks. These digital attacks are normally aimed at changing, accessing and damaging sensitive
personal information such as extorting money from users and interrupting normal business
process (Unknown). In order to have a successful cybersecurity is to have multiple layers of
protection across the networks, programs, computers and data that need to be kept safe and
secure. In a company such as organisations, the technology, processes and people must
contribute one another to create a strong and effective defence from digital attacks.

It is very challenging these days to implement effectiveness of cybersecurity measure as there
are many attackers becoming more innovative and more technologies and devices than people.
World like today where everything is connected, people are benefited from advanced cyber
defence programs. Because everyone relies their important information online, securing critical
infrastructure like power plants, hospitals and financial service companies are essential in order to
keep the society functioning.

To get to know how to secure the shared digital future, the users must understand how things
work. First of all, people all must understand how the security community believes the cyberthreat
will change and the consequent risk landscape will be transformed. This critical and urgent
analysis must be based on evidence and research, and must leverage the expertise of those in
academia, the technical community and policymakers around the world. By doing this, the security
ecosystem can help build a new generation of cybersecurity defences and partnerships that will
enable global prosperity(Unknown).

Driven by a new generation of transformative technology, the cybersecurity landscape is more
likely to be changed significantly within next 3 years and even in the next 10 years, the past 10
years was the only the beginning of the global cybersecurity journey. New architectures and
cooperation are required as we stand at the brink of a new era of cybercrime, which will be
empowered by new and emergent technology.

### Cloud Technology

It is known that cloud technology have a major impact on the revolution of security technology.
Nowadays many business organisations and government related agencies are using the cloud
technology to store vital informations every day. The cloud gives more security approaches and
techniques.

Mechanisms such as virtualised firewalls, virtualised intrusion detection, and preventions systems,
and virtualised systems can now be used from the cloud. For example, most businesses have
increased their data centre security by using IaaS services(Unknown).

### 5G networks

5G networks will the new generation of the single most challenging issue of the cybersecurity
landscape. This networks is not just designed for fast internet, it means that the world will go into a
new era, possibly by 2025, 75 billion new devices will be connecting to the internet every year,
running critical applications and infrastructure at nearly 1,000 times the speed of the current
internet(William Dixon,2019). This will be a better chance for connecting whole new communities,
geographies and industries, but at the same time it will a high risk of threat landscape, as it
enables the cybercrime to move from being an invisible(William Dixon,2019).

This 5G network will provide any cyber attackers with fast access to vulnerable networks. When
enterprise and operational technology is combined, a new type of cyberattacks will be born and
there are already some that exists.

“The recent ransomware attack against the US city of Baltimore, for example, locked 10,000
employees out of their workstations. In the near future, smart city infrastructures will provide
interconnected systems at a new scale, from transport systems for driverless cars, automated
water and waste systems, to emergency workers and services, all interdependent and - potentially
- as highly vulnerable as they are highly connected. In 2017, the WannaCry attack that took parts
of the UK’s National Health Service down took days to spread globally, but in a 5G era the malware
would spread this attack at the speed of light. It is clear that 5G will not only enable great prosperity
and help to save people’s lives, it will also have the capacity to thrust cybercrime into the real world
at a scale and with consequences yet unknown”(Dmitry Samartsev,2019).

### Hardware Authentication

The use of usernames and passwords are one of the well known shortcoming in cybersecurity, and
there is a need for a more strong and secure form of authentication. One of the recent technologies
is the use of authentication hardware.
For example, “Intel is now using this technology where it combines a variety of hardwareenhanced
factors simultaneously to validate a user’s identity. Hardware authentication is
particularly important in IoT where networks need to make sure that anything trying to gain access
to it is permitted to do so”(Unknown).

Cyberattacks have huge impact on political, economic and social systems in which we live, but not
only those organisations, individuals get huge impact on cyberattacks of affecting personal data
and privacy. I personally have not experienced any cyberattacks in my life, but as an individuals it
is that the average person needs to be increasingly cautious when it comes to protect their
personal information and data.

The straightforward response is that the average person needs to be increasingly cautious when it
comes to protecting their personal data. The implications for the average person range from
identity theft to financial losses to reputational damage resulting from non-consensual data dumps.
Email accounts, social media sites, and other personal information have already been
compromised (e.g., Equifax, OPM breaches)(Unknown,2018).

It’s important to remember that although high profile breaches garner the most media attention,
many cyber attacks are extremely personal. Social accounts, webcams, hacked emails and mobile
phones give numerous attack vectors for domestic assailants. As this takes up large part to the proliferation and accessibility of digital weapons, spyware and other surveillance tools can be
implanted. Therefore average person should follow some of the key tenets of safety when it comes
to password security and multi-factor authentication.

As long as our network is well protected and maintained, I do not think there will be major impact
on my friends and family. But we cannot assume it is safe, because there are always unexpected
things that might happen.

### Cloud Services and Servers

Cloud technology is accessing and storing data over the internet instead of a physical hard drive.
Put simply, this technology assists in the delivery of different services including accessing things
like storage or databases as well software to allow faster innervation, ease of access to resources
which in turn can potentially lower operational costs of a business. Cloud services are typically
broken down into 3 types, SaaS - software as a service, IaaS - infrastructure as a service and
PaaS – platform as a service.

Software as a service delivers the ability to access software or applications over the internet or
through a browser. One of the most well-known and popular type of this technology would be
Microsoft’s Office 365. It is common for SaaS applications to allow customers to enable addons
and modifications through an extensive configuration environment.

Infrastructure as a service outlines storage capability for a user, ranging from low end data storage
to high end databases. As outlined in software as a service Microsoft again brings a key
component to the table with OneDrive as well as Googles cloud platform. OneDrive and Google
Drive offer day to day use either on a personal scale or small business to allow easy access to
data via multiple avenues utilising the internet. Another large platform is Apples iCloud, allowing
people who own any iProduct to store and access from any of those devices at any time allowing
seamless collaboration or access of information when required. For business use, Dropbox is a
highlight as it uses a system like that of Windows explorer, allowing ease of access and automatic
backups saving within a system similar to that of regular saving process.

Platform as a service or PaaS technology integrates into a business already made software
infrastructure. It’s primary services assist in application design and testing for deployment,
integration of web based services as well as but not limited to database integration. This is mainly
executed through a cloud service providers infrastructure with users gaining access through a web
browser. Platform as a service can offer services such as application hosting or program
development which can be delivered through a public or private cloud. The principal benefit for this
type of technology is for convenience and simplicity.

These technologies have drastically grown over the past 20 years and cloud technology model has
altered the way organisations manage their technology systems and resources. Previously
businesses wanting to grow their own IT systems were required to establish their own
infrastructure which in turn could increase operating costs of a business as well as time and space
to maintain those pieces of equipment. Now, business can access endless opportunity that is cloud
computing. Allowing business to access data storage, software or essentially any of the 3
technology types outlined above at a reduced cost. These systems are maintained and managed
by a third party therefore allowing businesses to have the most current technologies without the
stress of maintenance costs and time.

Some of the positive impact of these technologies on businesses are costs, flexibility and increase
of capacity. Costs for businesses are reduced due to no further requirement to self-manage and
maintain the infrastructure. Costs for a business could go from thousands of dollars to a billing
system or service. Flexibility of these technologies allow ease of access to software. In the
instance where software developers need an environment to test or deploy products this can easily
be done utilising PaaS technologies. Benefits of storage capacity work with flexibility and ease of
collaboration. Allowing businesses to store data remotely allows them to have larger capacity and
the ability to access it from any machine on their network. In turn positive impacts that a business
may face is Improved productivity, ease of access as well as reduction in costs.

Negative impacts include Vendor lock-in, security breaches & loss of data. The initial service a
vendor may offer would likely be aligned with your business needs. A barrier faced with this is
when a business expands it’s need for further services the initial vendor may not offer this which
could lead to further costs changing vendors or the inability to do so due to a contact. Leaking of
sensitive data is a large privacy breach which could have legal consequence. Allowing a third party
to store this data may be one of greatest impacts when forming a decision to migrate to cloud
services. Loss of any data is a large concern to a person or business. Leaving the tasks of
backups, storage and maintenance to a third party would be a great risk initially. As a preventative
measure business could store data locally as well but that would ultimately defeat the purpose of
utilising that technology.

On a personal level, this technology is of benefit especially at work. At work I rely on being able to
access the network drives to ensure my day runs smoothly. Working from home in the current
climate the whole business is reliant on the use of Citrix Storefront which runs a virtual desktop and
allows us to work remotely. Outside of work I regally use OneDrive between my laptop and desktop
as well as iCloud for my phone. Utilising the technology to be able to complete these studies online
is another highlight as working full time & physically attending a university would be impossible.
With the growth of technologies allowing us to access services remotely will have an impact on a
person’s social skills and mental health. My goal in this field is to get into cloud & networking, so
hopefully the technology continues to grow and become dependant on allowing future potential
opportunities for myself and others with interest in this field.

### Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

**What does it do?**

_What is the state of the art of this new technology?_

Within the world of cryptocurrencies, three major cryptocurrencies have set themselves apart from
the rest. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have now been plastered on billboards, their names read
out on repeat on advertisements and for very good reason too. In 2017 the world witnessed the
peak of bitcoin and for many this was the first-time hearing of Cryptocurrencies. Many thought that
it was just a trend, but the virtual currencies have taken the world by storm. When Bitcoin rose to
peak popularity, Ethereum and Ripple soon followed suite as many were entranced by this new
form of currency and researched the new craze. Bitcoin remains the leader with a market value of
approximately $7,000 and a Market Cap of 129.73 billion dollars whereas Ethereum has a value of
$170.89 and a market cap of 18.79 billion dollars. Lastly, Ripple, which has a miniscule value of
$0.1885 to date but relies on it’s market cap of $8.31 billion dollars to thank for its popularity.
